              As we step into 2024 let us continue this journey of unlocking
              potential of children. Together, we can ensure that every child
              has the opportunity to explore, learn, and grow with the help of
              education.

              Children are the foundation of our country. It is crucial to
              ensure that all children have access to quality education, proper
              nutrition, and a safe environment, so they can reach their full
              potential. Therefore, Child Rights and You (CRY) has been working
              towards helping children achieve their dreams and providing them
              with the childhoods they truly deserve.

              CRY currently operates 102 projects in 19 states and 80 districts,

              support, we address children’s critical needs by working with
              parents, teachers, Anganwadi workers, communities, district and
              state-level governments as well as the children themselves. We
              work on changing behaviours and practices at the grassroots level
              and influencing public policy at a systemic level – thereby
              creating an ecosystem where children are made the nation’s
              priority. Our key focus areas include –
